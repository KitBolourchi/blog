I watched a presentation from the  KotlinConf'24 which peaked my interest.
The presentation was titled, 'The best programmer I know' and Daniel
Terhorst-North was presenting.

# Getting the job done
Part 1 of the talk mentioned the qualities of the best programmer is "Getting
the job done"

- Resist procrastination
- Know that you don't know
- Iterate wildly
